# EasyVst

EasyVst is a small, easy-to-use VST3 wrapper that makes it easy to host VST3 plugins without using JUCE or any other framework. By default, it uses SDL2 to create the window in which plugin GUIs are displayed; however, it should be straightforward to modify this code to use any other library for window creation.
